Characters page - it should include the list of all characters.
This page also should use REST API, it should include the list
of all characters It should be almost identical to the episodes
page, only use the character image for the list item + this
page should have a search by name of the character and
filtration by Status and Gender. There is no need to have a
modal window on this page. Display only info that doesnt
include the links here (apart from image).
